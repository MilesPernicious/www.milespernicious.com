*Miles Pernicious is now bringing Aloha spirit to the web!*

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --**

Aloha! I am so pleased to announce the launch of my new website!

I have taken care to ensure that the website would be based on open technologies, and accessible to everyone across devices.

I invite you all to take a look at www.milespernicious.com.

Some key aspects of the website include:

A blog where I will share a behind-the-scenes look at my personal projects

Tips and tricks for streaming, especially on Linux (*COMING SOON*)

Detailed information about upcoming live streams, including schedule

I am Miles Pernicious, a family friendly content creator, musician, and developer. I have been featured by Minecraft on their official Twitch stream multiple times.
