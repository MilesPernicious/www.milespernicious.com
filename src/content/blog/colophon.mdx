A colophon is used to give insight into the behind-the-scenes process used to create a work. In traditional print literature, colophons were included as an inscription at the end of a book.  This is the colophon for milespernicious.com.

***

Planning for the website began in November 2022, with prototyping beginning the following month.

It was created entirely on the [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org) Linux 37 operating system, using the [nano](https://nano-editor.org) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editors.  The markup is styled using [StylifyCSS](https://stylifycss.com/).  The site is packaged together using [Astro](https://astro.build).  The source code is committed to [GitHub](https://github.com) and subsequently built and hosted on [Render](https://render.com).

To maintain consistency throughout the site, all content is written in accordance with guidelines based on the [18F content guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/).  Drafts for articles are created and edited using [Nuclino](https://nuclino.com) and [Anytype](https://anytype.io).

The primary font used is [Commissioner](https://github.com/kosbarts/Commissioner). Our logo font is [Kanit](https://github.com/cadsondemak/kanit). We also use [Rock Salt](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/rock-salt) for our hero pages. To significantly reduce font sizes (and thereby make the site load faster for you), [Beatrix](https://github.com/funbox/beatrix) processed the fonts to remove unused character glyphs.

To further improve site load speed, some images have been processed by [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app), while others are hosted and processed on the [ImageKit](https://imagekit.io) content delivery network.
